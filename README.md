## Heya, I'm jade arson.!

> **side note:** my current projects are more likely to be found on [git.gay](https://git.gay/wolfyjade), and *not* on GitHub.  
> Same goes for some of my contributions, which now are over on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/wolfyjade).  
> The only reason why I still use GitHub is to occasionally contribute to the one or other project.

### small introduction:

- **pronouns:** she/her, it/its
- **languages:** English (friends say it's native-like), German (native)
- **skills:** sysadmining [Infrastructure as a Shitpost](https://status.wolfyja.de) since 2021, touching code occasionally, [configuring the hell out of my desktop setup and writing bodges to fix some issues I have](https://git.gay/wolfyjade/dotfiles), *idk what else to add (that's even remotely related to people that tend to use Git) ðŸ¥´*

### short-ish list of projects I contributed to:

- **[GoToSocial](https://codeberg.org/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial)** (in the form of some smaller fixes, bug reports and [writing a patchset that's currently live on gts.apicrim.es](https://git.gay/infrastructure-as-a-shitpost/gts.apicrim.es-patchset))
- **[as-a-treat](https://github.com/theresnotime/as-a-treat)**, a bot posting "X can have Y, as a t(h?)reat" every 2 hours into the Fediverse (in the form of adding some treats and folks)
- I also contributed to some smaller projects under names I no longer use ([of which one of those briefly got shown off at a GPN22 talk!](https://media.ccc.de/v/gpn22-244-bash-is-a-systems-programming-language#t=1158)), that's why I didn't include them here.
